    <p>from 1945 to 1995</p>
    <h3>1945</h3>
    <p>Vannevar Bush writes <a href="">an article</a> in <a href="">Atlantic Monthly</a> about a photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for memory extension, which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche</p>
    <h3>1960s</h3>
    <p>Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the <a href="">Bootstrap Institute library</a>.</p>
    <p>Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in<em>A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate</em>. 20th National Conference, New York,<a href="">Association for Computing Machinery</a> , 1965. See also: Literary Machines. Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link.</p>   
    <p>Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in 1967.</p>
    <h3>1980</h3>
    <p>While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III. See: <a href="">Enquire user manual as scanned images</a> or as <a href="">HTML page(alt)</a>.</p>

       <dd><a href="">Information Management: A Proposal"</a> written by<a href="">Tim BL</a>  and circulated for comments at CERN (TBL). Paper "HyperText and CERN" produced as background (<a href="">text</a>or<a href=""></a> WriteNow format)</dd>.

    <d1>May</d1>
           <dd>Same <a href="">proposal</a> recirculated</dd>
           <dl>September</dl>
                   <dd>Mike Sendall, Tim's boss, Oks the purchase of a NeXT cube, and allows Tim to go ahead and write a global hypertext system.</dd>
            <dl>October</dl>
                 <dd>Tim starts work on a hypertext GUI browser+editor using the NeXTStep development environment. He makes up "WorldWideWeb" as a name for the program. (See <a href="">the first browser</a> screenshot) "World Wide Web" as a name for the project (over Information Mesh, Mine of Information, and Information Mine).
                    Project <a href="">original proposal</a> reformulated with encouragement from CN and ECP divisional management. Robert <a href="">Cailliau</a> (ECP) joins and is co-author of <a href="">new version</a>.</dd>
            <dl>November</dl>
                    <dd>Initial<a href="">WorldWideWeb program</a>  development continues on the NeXT <a href="">(TBL)</a> . This was a "what you see is what you get" (wysiwyg) browser/editor with direct inline creation of links. The first web server was nxoc01.cern.ch, later called info.cern.ch, and the <strong>first web page</strong><br> http://nxoc01.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html Unfortunately CERN no longer supports the historical site. Note from this era too, the <a href="">least recently modified web page</a> we know of, last changed Tue, 13 Nov 1990 15:17:00 GMT (though the URI changed.)</dd>
            <dl>November</dl>
                    <dd>Technical Student Nicola <a href="">Pellow</a> (CN) joins and starts work on the line-mode browser. Bernd<a href="">Pollermann</a>  (CN) helps get interface to CERNVM "FIND" index running. TBL gives a <a href="">colloquium</a> on hypertext in general.</dd>
            <dl>Christmas</dl>
                    <dd>Line mode browser and <a href="">WorldWideWeb</a>WorldWideWeb browser/editor demonstrable. Acces is possible to hypertext files, CERNVM "FIND", and Internet news articles.</dd>
